# Frizzante - the Fritzbox - Plex DVR server

Are you annoyed by having too much systems to take care of?
You just want to watch TV using your Plex / Fritzbox cable setup?

Try this experimental server instead of using the TVHeadend / TVHProxy combination.

Cudos to TVHProxy folks, as this is heavily inspired by them.

## How to set up?
This is a simple Sinatra server that just needs ruby and ffmpeg as prerequisites.
Please check the Dockerfile for further explanation on how to handle.
Has been tested on my synology.

## Things on the todo list
- [] Allow multiple streams at once
